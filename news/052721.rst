Amarula Solutions has partnered with Engicam Srl and started a project
to push Engicam SOM’s and Carrier board’s BSP onto Mainline U-Boot,
Linux Kernel, Yocto/Buildroot and Multimedia Open source projects.

Here is that we mainlined i.Core MX8M Mini SoM, which is a NXP i.MX8MM based 
SoM along with two of its carrier boards namely EDIMM 2.2 and CTouch 2.0.

Along with Mainlining, we are also providing Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) Distribution
running flawlessly on their Carrier Boards.
