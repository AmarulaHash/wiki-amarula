CC3220SF LaunchXL Zephyr Setup
##############################

This tutorial shows you how to set up the CC3220SF LaunchXL board for use with Zephyr on Linux.

First time board configuration
==============================

Before the board can be used with Zephyr for the first time it must be flashed with a service pack. This only has to be done once for each board.

#. Download and install the `SDK <http://www.ti.com/tool/download/SIMPLELINK-CC32XX-SDK>`_ and `UniFlash <https://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Category:CCS_UniFlash>`_.

#. Set the SOP jumper to 010 as shown in the picture.

#. Update the service pack and set the device to developer mode using Uniflash.

   #. Start UniFlash with the board connected by USB. UniFlash should automatically detect the board as shown in the figure below. Click Start.

         .. image:: uf1.png

   #.  Click `New Project`

         .. image:: uf2.png

   #.  Give the project a name. Make sure the device type is set correctly and `Device Mode` is set to `Develop`. Click `Create Project`.

         .. image:: uf3.png

   #.  Click on `Connect` and select the service pack for this device. On a default instalation this file should be in `ti/simplelink_cc32xx_sdk_4_10_00_07/tools/cc32xx_tools/servicepack-cc3x20/sp_3.15.0.1_2.0.0.0_2.2.0.7.bin`.

         .. image:: uf4.png

   #.  On the right side the device information should now be listed. Double check that the mode is set to `Development`. Click `Burn` in the bottom right.

         .. image:: uf5.png

   #.  Click `Program Image` and wait for it to complete.

#. Update XDS-110.

   #. Download and install the xds-110 software `here <https://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/esd/documents/xdsdebugprobes/emu_xds_software_package_download.html#XDS_Emulation_Software_.28emupack.29_Download>`_.

   #. Switch to the instalation directory of the XDS110 software:

         .. code-block:: none

               cd ~/ti/ccs_base/common/uscif/xds110/

   #. Check that the device is correctly detected using the following command: 

         .. code-block:: none

            ./xdsdfu -e

      The output should look like this:

         .. code-block:: none

   #. Put the XDS110 in DFU mode:

         .. code-block:: none

            ./xdsdfu -m

   #. Update the XDS110 firmware:

         .. code-block:: none

            ./xdsdfu -f firmware_3.0.0.11.bin -r

#. Set the SOP jumper to 001 as shown in the picture.

Zephyr Tools
============

Follow :ref:`these <zephyr-setup>` steps to download and set up zephyr and its build tools.

Environment
===========

Follow `step 6 <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html>`_ to set up the zephyr toolchain and the two environment variables `ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT` and `ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR`. Create a script that sets those and source it before starting a development session.

Build and run
=============

In order to build and run zephyr on the board use the following commands:

.. code-block:: none

   cd ~/zephyrproject
   west build -b cc3220sf_launchxl -s zephyr/samples/hello_world/
   west flash
